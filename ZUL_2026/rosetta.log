You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
